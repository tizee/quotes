# quotes

A collection of quotes or excerpts that I found from this lovely world.

- quotes are in `json` format using schema defined in `schema.json`.

## Motivation

- I'd like to understand some quotes I like from reading. And through increasing the frequency of their appearance via `fortune` in terminal environment can remind me to apply the ideas I learn from them.

## Fortune

### Install fortune

- macOS

```
brew install fortune
```

### Install quotes

- install into fortune data directory
```
python3 generate.py --fortune
./scripts/install_fortune.sh
```

## Roadmap

- ✅ `fortune` strings format
- [ ] Web UI
- [ ] backend quote service
